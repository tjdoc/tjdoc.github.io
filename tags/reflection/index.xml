      <description>2cor 10:3. For although we do live in the world, we do not wage war in a worldly way; 2cor 10:4. because the weapons we use to wage war are not worldly. On the contrary, they have God’s power for demolishing strongholds. We demolish arguments 2cor 10:5. and every arrogance that raises itself up against the knowledge of God; we take every thought captive and make it obey the Messiah.</description>

      <description>By David:
Adonai is my light and salvation;
whom do I need to fear?
Adonai is the stronghold of my life;
of whom should I be afraid?
When evildoers assailed me
to devour my flesh,
my adversaries and foes,
they stumbled and fell.
If an army encamps against me,
my heart will not fear;
if war breaks out against me,
even then I will keep trusting.
Just one thing have I asked of Adonai;</description>

      <description>For the leader. A psalm of David: May Adonai answer you in times of distress, may the name of the God of Ya‘akov protect you. May he send you help from the sanctuary and give you support from Tziyon. May he be reminded by all your grain offerings and accept the fat of your burnt offerings. (Selah) May he grant you your heart’s desire and bring all your plans to success.</description>
